# hello-world-nodejs
This is a sample hello world web NodeJs app.
It uses only built-in NodeJs modules for simplicty.

# Purpose
This simple app will create an id on the start of the instance that will not change with page refreshes but will change with container restarts. Basically every container will have a unique ID for the purpose of testing the load balancers.
